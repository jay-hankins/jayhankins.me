Then later on, I found out about Firefox, and CSS 2, and WYSIWYG\n  editors (Nvu/KompoZer) and I very specifically remember making a website for\n  my school with this [theme](http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3560/). In\n  high school, I made some Wordpress themes for local businesses. And now, I use\n  React and babel and VS Code. The web is pure, unadulterated techno-fun.\n      </AboutParagraph>\n      <AboutParagraph emoji=\"👨🏻‍🏫\" mdxType=\"AboutParagraph\">\n  I’m a computer scientist by education, but I’d rather talk to people than\n  machines. I love to help people learn new things, and consider myself to be a\n  good asset in bridging the gap between the technical and non-technical. At\n  Purdue, I lectured CS 193: Tools, in which 500 computer science freshmen\n  learned the basics of Unix-like terminals, text editors, and git.\n      </AboutParagraph>\n    </AboutLayout>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
