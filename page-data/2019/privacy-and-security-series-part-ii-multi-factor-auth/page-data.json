In the face of data breaches and credential\ndumps occurring nearly every day, you need a strategy to protect yourself.\nSingle-factor password authentication is weak, but password managers are a convenient tool to help you lock down your online accounts and localize\na breach so that one leaked credential doesn’t give an attacker the “keys to the\nkingdom”. It’s all about preventing access to your accounts, people.</p>\n<p>By the way, in March news broke that 8fit had a data breach in July 2018. While\nthe breach happened in July, the credential list didn’t appear for sale on the\ndark web until February 2019. My credentials, along with about 15 million\nothers’, were leaked. Thanks to <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com\">HaveIBeenPwned</a>, I\nknew as soon as the experts did. If you didn’t sign up for it the <a href=\"../privacy-and-security-series-part-i-password-managers/\">last time I\nmentioned it</a>, I again\nrecommend it.</p>\n<p>In addition to adhering to password manager best practices, you can bring\nanother layer of security to your online accounts with multi-factor\nauthentication. Welcome to Part 2, all about multi-factor auth, why it’s useful,\nand how to set it up the right way.</p>\n<h2>What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?</h2>\n<p>When a system needs to authenticate that you are who you say you are, it can use\na variety of factors, or pieces of information, to verify your identity. Many\nsystems just use one factor, like a single password.</p>\n<p>Multi-factor Authentication is authentication that relies on more than one\nfactor to verify you. Many things might be factors: security questions, one-time\npasswords, a PIN, etc. For example, a common multi-factor authentication scheme\nthat you see with major U.S. bank websites involves both a password and a\none-time passcode sent to your cellphone. Or, as Wikipedia points out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A good example of two-factor authentication is the withdrawing of money from\nan ATM; only the correct combination of a bank card (something the user\npossesses) and a PIN (something the user knows) allows the transaction to be\ncarried out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Multi-factor auth strategies are becoming more and more common. Two-factor\nauthentication (2FA) usually involves a password (factor #1) and a token code\n(factor #2). The 2FA strategy is sometimes referred to as “something you know\n(the <em>password</em>) and something you have (the <em>token</em>).”</p>\n<p>2FA has actually been around for a while, especially in enterprise and\ngovernment. Many folks will have used or at least seen an <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_SecurID\">RSA\nSecurID</a>, which is probably the\nsingle best-selling hardware token for 2FA. <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

More generally, MFA protects you when one of\nyour factors is compromised.</p>\n<p>Say you only use a username/password combination to log into your Google/Gmail\nAccount. That’s one factor, the password. If it’s leaked, <strong>100%</strong> of the\nauthentication factors are compromised. Your account is hacked.</p>\n<p><strong>But</strong>, if you use MFA, and the password is leaked, only <strong>50%</strong> of the auth\nfactors are compromised. The second factor is still unknown or unavailable to\nthe attacker. For example, if your second authenticator is your (unhacked)\nsmartphone, and it’s in your pocket, the attacker won’t have all the factors and\nwon’t get in. Your account is safe.</p>\n<p>MFA is <em>especially</em> useful for those pesky websites that have password length or\ncharacter limitations. We <a href=\"../privacy-and-security-series-part-i-password-managers/\">all\nknow</a> that\n<code class=\"language-text\">Correct.horse-battery$Staple</code> is a better password than <code class=\"language-text\">M@nc#3$ter</code>… but for\nthose sites that only support 16 characters [A-z1-9], a second authentication\nfactor will drastically increase your security.</p>\n<h2>How to Set Up MFA</h2>\n<p>Hopefully I have you convinced that MFA is important… the next step is to set\nthis up for yourself. Luckily, we aren’t the only ones who have realized the\nbenefit to MFA. Major online service providers are now 2/MFA enabled, and you’ve\nprobably been prompted to set it up before.</p>\n<p>Probably the first thing you’ll need to do is choose a MFA token type. You can\nchoose one or many, depending on your wants and needs.</p>\n<h3>Types of MFA Tokens</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SMS</strong> - Text messaging is on the list first <em>not</em> because it is the most\nsecure, but because it’s the most popular. Many, many websites now offer SMS\none-time passwords, and unfortunately it’s sometimes all they offer. However,\nSMS one-time passwords are better than nothing!</li>\n<li><strong>Software Token</strong> - Software that generates one-time-passwords based on a\ncryptographic function of time and a token secret, which is given to you by\nthe service provider when you set up 2FA. Most commonly you see TOTP\n(Time-based One-Time Password) generators. When you set up an authenticator\napp with a secret code or a QR code, you are using a TOTP software token.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware Token</strong> - There are a variety of hardware tokens. Some are OTP\ngenerators with a button press to generate codes, and others like the RSA\ntoken are always-on and cycle through a number of TOTP codes.</li>\n<li><strong>Push Authentication</strong> - Push authentication is an MFA factor popularized by\nDuo, Authy, and Google. Basically, a push notification is sent to your\nsmartphone and you approve or deny the request via the respective app. For\nexample, Google can send Push Authentication notifications to any iOS device\nwith the Gmail or Google apps installed.</li>\n<li><strong>And More</strong> - Yubikeys are a popular type of hardware token. They have\nmultiple modes of operation, including TOTP, U2F, Fido, and other choice\nprotocols, but also a specialized Yubico code which is based off the key’s\nserial number, and a PIV mode for smart card protocols. Another app, called\nKrypton, emulates a hardware U2F key and can support MFA for SSH logins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>What’s wrong with SMS?</em></strong> SMS is the most popular, but probably weakest form\nof MFA. This is because it’s relatively easy for an attacker to convince your\ncell phone carrier that they are you, and the carrier will provision them a new\nSIM card, and from then on it is the attacker who receives your SMS one time\npasswords. I quickly Googled and found\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@CodyBrown/how-to-lose-8k-worth-of-bitcoin-in-15-minutes-with-verizon-and-coinbase-com-ba75fb8d0bac\">two</a>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-most-expensive-lesson-of-my-life-details-of-sim-port-hack-35de11517124\">cases</a>\nwhere cell phone carriers were the weak link and allowed an unauthorized user to\nget a SIM card for your account. I recommend reading the two posts for full\ndetails.</p>\n<h2>Where to Set Up MFA</h2>\n<p>Ideally, you’ll set up 2FA everywhere! That said, you should enable 2FA on these\nat a minimum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your webmail</li>\n<li>financial sites</li>\n<li>healthcare/insurance sites</li>\n<li>social media accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first is obvious, I hope. If an attacker gets your email credentials, you’re\npretty much done for. That’s because your email can probably be used to receive\npassword reset emails for all your other accounts.</p>\n<p>Financial, healthcare, and insurance sites all hold a variety of sensitive data\nand breaches to those accounts can have material impacts on your life very\nquickly. It’s best to multi-factor those for extra peace of mind.</p>\n<p>Finally, I think it’s important that social media accounts be protected by MFA.\nIt could be incredibly damaging for someone to hack your social media account\nand make false claims about you. Your character could be damaged, so I consider\nsocial media to be a high-risk environment needing extra security.</p>\n<p>Here’s a great resource for knowing which online services support MFA:\n<a href=\"https://twofactorauth.org/\">https://twofactorauth.org/</a>. I recommend going through every service in the list\nand enabling 2FA for all that you have.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3933cc82b9a3aa452ce5a82c4732f33a/d84c6/2019-05-25-19-08-57.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 89.30434782608695%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Screenshot of Twofactorauth.org\"\n        title=\"Screenshot of Twofactorauth.org\"\n        src=\"/static/3933cc82b9a3aa452ce5a82c4732f33a/b9e4f/2019-05-25-19-08-57.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3933cc82b9a3aa452ce5a82c4732f33a/cf440/2019-05-25-19-08-57.png 148w,\n/static/3933cc82b9a3aa452ce5a82c4732f33a/d2d38/2019-05-25-19-08-57.png 295w,\n/static/3933cc82b9a3aa452ce5a82c4732f33a/b9e4f/2019-05-25-19-08-57.png 590w,\n/static/3933cc82b9a3aa452ce5a82c4732f33a/f9b6a/2019-05-25-19-08-57.png 885w,\n/static/3933cc82b9a3aa452ce5a82c4732f33a/2d849/2019-05-25-19-08-57.png 1180w,\n/static/3933cc82b9a3aa452ce5a82c4732f33a/d84c6/2019-05-25-19-08-57.png 2300w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>PCMag (hey, remember them? used to love that magazine) has a very thorough\narticle on <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/feature/358289/two-factor-authentication-who-has-it-and-how-to-set-it-up\">how to set up 2FA for over 30 different online\nservices</a>.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you recommend a specific 2FA authenticator app?</strong></p>\n<p>No, I find them all to be about the same. I always prefer U2F or push\nnotification authorization to TOTP apps (like Google Authenticator), but I\nuse Authy for services where that’s the only option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Isn’t this a bit inconvenient?</strong></p>\n<p>What’s more inconvenient, having to key in 2FA codes or having your accounts\nstolen from you? Keying in MFA codes a few times a (week/day/hour) is worth\nit because of how much more secure the practice can make your accounts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What about logging into applications?</strong></p>\n<p>This is a bit of a caveat. Modern applications that use OAUTH2 for logging\ninto web services will typically <strong>not</strong> need any special treatment.\nActually, they are secured through the online service’s MFA login. For\nexample, adding a Gmail account to an iPhone loads a Google login flow page.</p>\n<p>Other, older applications might need a statically generated password that\nbypasses the MFA login flow. For example, using Gmail over the IMAP protocol\nwill need what Google calls an “application password”.</p>\n<p>You’ll have to check with your online service to find out how to handle each\nsituation, but generally speaking, if you can’t access the login provider’s\npage, (e.g. the Google login flow) and are keying credentials into form\nfields in the application, you will need to obtain a static password.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Why is SMS 2FA bad?</strong></p>\n<p>Generally speaking, SMS 2FA is fine. I’m not sure about the security of the\nSMS protocol, but I mean it’s probably safe to bet that various government\nagencies could intercept your SMS codes. Do they want to? Probably not, but I\ndon’t know what my readers are getting up to.</p>\n<p>The bigger danger is from your cell phone carrier itself- it seems that it’s\nfairly easy for an attacker to socially engineer their way into obtaining a\nSIM card for <em>your</em> account. Then, suddenly, text messages meant for you are\ngoing to their phone, and they can get those SMS 2FA codes.</p>\n<p>Make sure you’ve taken security seriously with your cell phone carrier. Avoid\nusing real answers to the security questions, and make sure you have any\nlocks turned on. Some carriers allow you to set a passphrase or PIN which\nwould be required to process any changes on the account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What happens if I lose my token (or phone)?</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there aren’t easy answers to this. The harder you make it for\nattackers to get into your account, the harder it will be for you to get into\nyour account if you ever lose an authentication factor.</p>\n<p>When you enable 2FA with online services, they will typically provide you\nbackup codes to print and store for safekeeping. It’s very important to keep\nthese backup codes, else you may not have other ways to get in.</p>\n<p>My personal strategy includes having additional Yubikeys in safe locations in\nthe (unlikely, I hope) event that lose my primary authenticators.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What are some other advantages and disadvantages of using mobile phones as\nauthentication tokens?</strong></p>\n<p>Mobile phones are a great way to get started with two-factor authentication,\neither by SMS or a TOTP authenticator app. Authenticator apps are better\ntypically. Wikipedia has a great\n<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Use_of_mobile_phones\">section</a>\non the advantages and disadvantages. <strong>tl;dr:</strong> phones may not be a great\noption if your data connection isn’t solid, and SMS delivery can be flaky\nin general. TOTP authenticator apps overcome this since the OTP is generated\non-device.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Next Time</h2>\n<p>And… that’s about it! Thanks for reading Part II. There’s more we could say\nabout multi-factor auth, and we will! In Part III, we’ll talk about advanced\nmulti-factor strategies focused primarily on Yubikey. (Spoiler: I started\nwriting this article before acquiring Yubikeys…) You think we’re secure? You\nain’t seen nothing yet.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>  I’m not particularly interested in looking up whether this is true or not, all\nI know is that SecurIDs were and are everywhere. My mom had one in the late\n90s/early 2000s and she didn’t work in tech, so it’s not like 2FA is a recent\nor nerdy development. (Does anyone have a picture of the credit card-sized RSA\ntoken from back then? I can’t quite remember what it looks like, but I think\nit was white… I’m dying to see a picture for nostalgia’s sake.)</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>  Did you know that SecurID systems used to have the concept of a “duress PIN”?\nThis was a PIN that provided access but also silently logged a message for the\nsysadmin to know that the user was forced to authenticate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On older versions of SecurID, a “duress PIN” may be used—an alternate code\nwhich creates a security event log showing that a user was forced to enter\ntheir PIN, while still providing transparent authentication. Using the\nduress PIN would allow one successful authentication, after which the token\nwill automatically be disabled. The “duress PIN” feature has been deprecated\nand is not available on currently supported versions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>  Imagine the situation that caused the invention of that feature!
