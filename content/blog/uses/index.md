This page catalogs the hardware and software that I use on a daily basis.

I love learning about how people use their computers, and similarly love sharing how I use mine. I've created a pretty customized setup over the years, and I'm pretty picky, so this serves as a lowkey review page for the apps and products I use.

You may be familiar with other `/uses` pages. The idea comes from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com), and you can view geek out on other people's setups at [wesbos/awesome-uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses).
