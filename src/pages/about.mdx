## About Me

<AboutParagraph emoji="👨🏻‍💻">

Hi, my name is Jay, and I know just enough about computers to be dangerous.

<AboutParagraph emoji="☁️">

I’m a passionate technologist who believes in bringing people and the power of
technology together. I’m currently a Site Reliability Engineer at Salesforce,
where I work on public cloud operations and evangelize reliability best
practices to our software delivery teams.

Previously, I’ve worked at companies like Cisco and RSA Security, developing
web apps, investigating malware, and taking down cyber fraud activity.

<AboutParagraph emoji="🌎">

I love the web. I had dialup as a kid, but I realized I could build a website
in Microsoft Word that loaded very fast (and looked marvelous in Internet
Explorer)! Then later on, I found out about Firefox, and CSS 2, and WYSIWYG
editors (Nvu/KompoZer) and I very specifically remember making a website for
my school with this [theme](http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3560/). In
high school, I made some Wordpress themes for local businesses. And now, I use
React and babel and VS Code. The web is pure, unadulterated techno-fun.

<AboutParagraph emoji="👨🏻‍🏫">
  I’m a computer scientist by education, but I’d rather talk to people than
  machines. I love to help people learn new things, and consider myself to be a
  good asset in bridging the gap between the technical and non-technical. At
  Purdue, I lectured CS 193: Tools, in which 500 computer science freshmen
  learned the basics of Unix-like terminals, text editors, and git.
